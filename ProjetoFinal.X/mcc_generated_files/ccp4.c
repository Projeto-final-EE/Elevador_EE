  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file for the CCP4 driver using PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs

  @Description
    This source file provides implementations for driver APIs for CCP4.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs - 1.81.8
        Device            :  PIC16F1827
        Driver Version    :  2.0.3
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 2.36 and above
         MPLAB 	          :  MPLAB X 6.00
