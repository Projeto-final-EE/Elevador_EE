  @Summary
    Initializes the CMP2

  @Description
    This routine initializes the CMP2.
    This routine must be called before any other CMP2 routine is called.
    This routine should only be called once during system initialization.

  @Preconditions
    None

  @Param
    None

  @Returns
    None

  @Example
    <code>
    CMP2_Initialize();
    </code>

  @Summary
    Gets the CMP2 output status.

  @Description
    This routine gets the CMP2 output status.

  @Preconditions
    The CMP2 initializer routine should be called
    prior to use this routine.

  @Param
    None

  @Returns
    high  - if the CMP2 output is high.
    low   - if the CMP2 output is low.

  @Example
    <code>
    #define LED_On  LATAbits.LATA0=1
    #define LED_Off LATAbits.LATA0=0

    CMP2_Initialize();
